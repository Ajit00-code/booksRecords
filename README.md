Export the both projects (UI and backend) to your local.

You can directly run index.html file from UI project it doesn't need any configuration.

Backend-Project :
-For backend you need to setup java environment on your system.
-Because it uses mongoDB database, you need to install mongoDB server and need to create database in it with name "booksRecordManagement".
after creating database you have to import 3 json files ( Author-data.json, Book-data.json, Publisher-data.json ) from location 
"booksRecord\BooksRecordManagement-engine\src\main\resources".
- And done you can now run your Back-end project by using any java supported IDE or building the jar.
